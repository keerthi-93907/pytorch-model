            "The sky is blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh Scattering**, which describes how light interacts with particles much smaller than its wavelength. Here's a breakdown:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Sunlight is White Light:** Sunlight, which appears white to us, is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). Each color has a different wavelength; blue and violet light have very short, small wavelengths, while red and orange light have much longer, larger wavelengths.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Earth's Atmosphere:** Earth's atmosphere is a mix of gases (mainly nitrogen and oxygen) and tiny particles. These gas molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Scattering of Light:** When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it bumps into these gas molecules. This process is called **scattering**.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Wavelength Matters:**\n",
            "    *   **Blue and violet light** (shorter wavelengths) are scattered much more effectively and in all directions by the tiny molecules in the atmosphere than the other colors. This is because their short wavelengths are \"just the right size\" to interact strongly with the small air molecules.\n",
            "    *   **Red, orange, and yellow light** (longer wavelengths) pass through the atmosphere with much less scattering and tend to travel in straighter lines.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **What We See:** Because blue light is scattered in all directions, we see blue light coming from every part of the sky. The scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all angles, making the sky appear blue.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Why Not Violet?** While violet light actually scatters even *more* than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and there's also slightly less violet light emitted by the sun to begin with. So, we perceive the overall effect as blue.\n",
            "\n",
            "**In summary:** The tiny molecules in Earth's atmosphere preferentially scatter the shorter-wavelength blue and violet light from the sun, sending it in all directions. This scattered blue light is what reaches our eyes, making the sky appear blue.\n",
            "\n",
            "**What about sunsets and sunrises?**\n",
            "At sunrise or sunset, the sun's light has to travel through much more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes. By this point, most of the blue and green light has been scattered away, leaving primarily the longer-wavelength red and orange light to come through directly, which is why the sky near the horizon often appears red, orange, or pink during these times.\n"
